# K-Means-Clustering-Mini-Project

#With wine, we know there's red and white, but could there be a more meaningful grouping to use in classifying wine for consumers? 

#For this project we are applying k-means clustering (an unsupervised machine learning technique) to see if we can gain a meaningful insight into classifying wine using chemical data. 

#Bottom line: machine learning can't do much better than just using color in classifying wine, for now. There's actually red wine, white wine, and vinho verde (Portuguese for "green wine") and interestingly enough, this algorithm classified the wine data into three groups as well and with an accuracy of 44%.
