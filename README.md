# K-Means-Clustering-Mini-Project

With wine, we know there's red and white, but could there be a more meaningful grouping to use in classifying wine for consumers? 

For this project we are applying k-means clustering (an unsupervised machine learning technique) to see if we can gain a meaningful insight into classifying wine using chemical data.
